#WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM

Wiper is an device used to clean the front window of the car from rain , snow , washer fluid , water and a debris . Almost all motor vehicles, including autmobiles,
trucks ,buses ,train locomotives and cabin water craft as well as some aircrafts have one or more of these wipers, which are usually required by law. A wiper
is made up of a metal arm width one end pivoting and other end having long rubber blade attached to it. Usually an elctric motor is used to drive the wiper arm. 
The blade is swung back and forth across the window, removing any water particles, any dust , or other obstructions to view. The vehicles after 1969 have the speed 
changing abiulity with various speeds and often more interrupted settings. 
Many commercial cars have one or more arms. While most personal autos use two synchronized radial type arms. 

A wind screen washer system is also used on some vehicles to improve and broaden the wiper function to dry icy conditions . Several well placed nozzles spray water
or antifreeze window washer fluid at the wind screen with this method. When utilized in conjunction with the wiper blades , the mechanism aids in the removal of 
dirt and dust from the wind screen . In this project I will explain about how wiper works on STM32, an ARM Based Microcontroller
